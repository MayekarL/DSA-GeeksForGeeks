Lets assume X = 3 -> 11
4. Left Shift ('<<')
 - Will add the number of zeros at the end 
   If the number is 2 we have to add 2 zeros at the end
	x << 2      -> 1100
	
Lets assume X = 12 -> 1100
5. Right Shift ('>>')
 - Will add the number of zeros at the Start 
   If the number is 2 we have to remove 2 numbers from the end
	x << 2      -> 	11 
	Output 		->   3 

6. Bitwise Not : ('~') Unsigned 
  It will reverse if there is 0 it will make 1 
  Number   Output 
  0  		1
  1         0
