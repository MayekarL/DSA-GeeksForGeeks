Bitwise  
& 		-> AND
| 		-> OR
^ 		-> XOR 

Considering Number as 3 , 4

AND ('&')
Here 
0 & 1 = 0
0 & 0 = 0
1 & 0 = 0
1 & 1 = 1

Example 
3 		->  0 1 1   
4 		->  1 0 0 
		->  0 0 0   //Ans is 0 

OR ('|')
 
0 & 0 = 0
0 & 1 = 1
1 & 0 = 1
1 & 1 = 1		

Example 
3 		->  0 1 1   
4 		->  1 0 0 
		->  1 1 1   //Ans is 6

XOR ('^')
 
0 & 0 = 0
0 & 1 = 1
1 & 0 = 1
1 & 1 = 0		

Example 
3 		->  0 1 1   
4 		->  1 0 0 
		->  1 1 1   //Ans is 6
